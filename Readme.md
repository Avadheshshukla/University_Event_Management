## Models Key Features🔑
### 1 -> Student Model
    Attribute's
      -> StudentId (Integer)
      -> FirstName (String)
      -> LastName (String)
      -> Age (Integer)
      -> Department (Enum: ME, ECE, Civil, CSE)
 

### 2 -> Event Model

      -> EventId (Integer)
      -> EventName (String)
      -> LocationOfEvent (String)
      -> Date (LocalDate)
      -> StartTime (LocalTime)
      -> EndTime (LocalTime)


<!-- Usage -->
## Usage
- Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Use the provided API endpoints to manage your User Management.

### Controller🎮:
- It consists of a class named APIController which basically controls the flow of data.
- @RestController annotation is used to make the APIController as a controller layer.
- We perform the CRUD operations such as @PostMapping , @GetMapping , @PutMapping , @DeleteMapping.

### Endpoint API Reference :

#### StudentController :
     Endpoints:
         -> POST /addStudents - Add a new student
